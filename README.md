## Checklist
- ✅ A form for creating a new Ethereum wallet with an arbitrary name
- ✅ Show all previously created wallets in a simple list
- ✅ Remember created wallets between page refreshes (use local storage)
- ✅ Show wallet balances next to the wallets
- ⚠️ Update wallet balances periodically (or better: on balance changes): `Wallets get updated every 30 seconds or by the reload button on right bottom side of the page.`
- ⚠️ A form for sending ETH from a wallet to another. Refresh the balances of relevant wallets after the transaction is complete.: `User will be able to see updated balances on next reload.
- ✅ Functionality is presented in an easy to use and polished UI/UX

Didn't have enough time to implement page reloads on balance changes. I believe it could be done via web sockets.
